My project is SUPERHotlineMiami112, a remake of the browser game SUPERHotlineMiami112. It is a 2d, top-down action game with one-hit-kills, and has the unique feature of time moving slowly when the player is not moving. Additionally, it includes procedurally generated levels and a level editor, features which were not present in the original game.

To start the game, run the main file, term_project.py. Other required files/resources are included in the FINAL directory, and require no setup.

The only external module is simpleaudio. This must be installed on the system for the game to run. cmu_112_graphics.py is included in the FINAL directory.

The only shortcuts are the default cmu_112_graphics/Tkinter shortcuts. Because each level is short, all features of the game can be experienced quickly with no additional shortcuts.
